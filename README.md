# Random Quote Generator
 Website that displays my favorite quotes on creativity, persistence, simplicity and a patient-centered approach to using technology in the healthcare
 industry and the importance of technology in the education industry. 

 This project showcases my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals such as syntax, loops, conditionals and object literals put to use to: 
	- Build an array of quote objects to store the quotes
	- Write my own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen
